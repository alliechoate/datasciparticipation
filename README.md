## Basic Set-Up:

This repo contains various class participation files from the Data Science & Visualization course at USF from spring semester of 2020. 

The link to the class website can be found [here](https://wiernik-datasci.netlify.app/).





#### Details on Navigating This Repo:

My participation repo is organized according to guidelines that can be found [here](https://wiernik-datasci.netlify.app/evaluation/participation_checklist/). Specifically, code is sorted into folders corresponding to different topic areas that were covered before the world spiraled into mass chaos. A brief overview is provided below, with more specific details of each folder found in their respective 'README.md' files. 


**1.) Class Meeting 1b: Introduction to R**

  - This folder contains a basic .R script that orients the user to some basic fundamentals for using R (e.g., how to take a mean of a variable).
  
  
**2.) Class Meeting 2a Rmarkdown:**
    
  - This folder consists of documents that orient the user to Rmarkdown. Specifically, different output files (e.g., .html, .md) are rendered from a basic .Rmd file that displays some formatting options when using Rmarkdown. 
 
  - *Importantly, files from this unit are located under 'tools'*
  
  
**3.) Intro to Plotting With ggplot2:**

  - As the title suggests, this folder is titled 'plotting' and goes over some simple as well as advanced features of ggplot2 for creating numerous types of plots with various forms of data (i.e., categorical and continuous variables).
  
  
**4.) Intro to Data Wrangling:**

  - This folder has several subfolders, including:
      
      - Import and Export (contains code for exporting files using 'here' and 'dir')
        
      - Pivoting & Tibbles (contains code for pivot_wider and pivot_longer and working with tibbles)
        
      - Pure Wrangling (contains code from 2 exercises that demonstrate how to 'wrangle ones data' using tidyverse packages)
        
**5.) Factors (optional)**

  - This folder contains some basic code for manipulating and working with factors (both in terms of plotting and subsetting data)
