# Class Meeting 1b - Intro to R


This folder contains one R script that has very basic code and is meant to orient the user to some of R's basic functions.

For example, some topics that are covered include:

  - Working with and subsetting vectors
  - Base R functions (e.g., 'mean', 'na.rm', 'sum', etc.)
  - Exploring and loading dataframes
