# Tools


This folder contains some basic files that orient the user to Rmarkdown.

Specifically, the file 'navigating_github' was a test opportunity to 1) render a Rmarkdown document, and 2) provide links to my personal as well as the classroom GitHub pages.

The file 'Rmdexploration' shows some basic functionality of Rmarkdown, such as code folding options, theme changes, and using a table of contents (at least in the .html file).
 
 - This file also displays some basic functions using the 'mtcars' dataset that is located in the 'car' package
 
 - The gapminder dataset (located in the gapminder package) is also used to illustrate some base R functions
