# Wrangling

This folder contains 3-subfolders. Information on each subfolder is listed below.

### Pivoting and Tibble Practice

  - Contains two sets of .Rmd/.html/.md files for learning to pivot data and working with tibbles. 
  
  - The pivot file (as the name suggests) provides coding exercises on changing data structures from wide format to long format.
  These functions replaced previous functions (i.e., 'gather' and 'spread'), which some users may be familiar with
  
  - The tibble file consists of examples of how to work with tibbles, including merging/joining functions. 
   I would recommend reviewing the visual illustrations of joining tibbles/dataframes that can be found [here](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain)
   
 
### Pure Wrangling

  - This folder consists of two exercises (s04 and s05) that go over important data wrangling/tidy functions that are helpful to know
  - The worksheets can be found using this [link](https://wiernik-datasci-guide.netlify.app/wrangle-yo-data.html)
  - Main topics covered include orientation to dplyr syntax, such as using the pipe function (%<%), as well as other functions like "group_by()
or "summarize()" -- these worksheets also include some comparisons to base R functions
