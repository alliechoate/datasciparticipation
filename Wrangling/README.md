# Wrangling

This folder contains 3-subfolders. Information on each subfolder is listed below.


---




### Pivoting and Tibble Practice

  - Contains two sets of .Rmd/.html/.md files for learning to pivot data and working with tibbles. 
  
  - The pivot file (as the name suggests) provides coding exercises on changing data structures from wide format to long format.
  These functions replaced previous functions (i.e., 'gather' and 'spread'), which some users may be familiar with
  
  - The tibble file consists of examples of how to work with tibbles, including merging/joining functions. 
   I would recommend reviewing the visual illustrations of joining tibbles/dataframes that can be found [here](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain)
   
 
### Pure Wrangling

  - This folder consists of two exercises (s04 and s05) that go over important data wrangling/tidy functions that are helpful to know
  - The worksheets can be found using this [link](https://wiernik-datasci-guide.netlify.app/wrangle-yo-data.html)
  - Main topics covered include orientation to dplyr syntax, such as using the pipe function (%<%), as well as other functions like "group_by()
or "summarize()" -- these worksheets also include some comparisons to base R functions


### Import and Export

 - This folder has some data and one R script that contains code on exporting files to a different directory on your computer. This can be very helpful for when you want to save a table, figure, or data to a specific area for easy file referencing.
 
 - More details on this unit can be found [here](https://wiernik-datasci-guide.netlify.app/file-inputoutput-io.html)
 
 - This folder does not have an exercise per se but does give examples of how to export objects to designated areas and also covers more advanced data importing topics (e.g., how to import data from the internet, importing SPSS files, etc.)
